<p>
  The purpose of the laboratory was to add Javascript functionality to the
  Shopping List and as optional some CSS. If the input is not empty, when
  clicking the "Add item" button it would be added having two buttons with
  different options (Check and Delete).
  Clicking the "Check" option will cross the text of the current item.
  On the other hand clicking the "delete" option will delete the item as expected.
